They will know my rage
The sleeper is awake
I saw my future and my fate
In a strange and dreamlike state
My old life is left far behind

Lines of time
In my visions I can see them all
Unified
But the prophecy still insecure
I'll revolize the future

Enlightened with a different name
Given by the second moon
Leader of the native tribes of Dune

As foretold
The seas of sand are now my home
In days of old
Nevermore I walk alone
Know thy fate
The meaning of my dreams now clear
Legions wait
And revolution's here

Father, the sleeper has awakened!

As foretold
The seas of sand are now my home
In days of old
Nevermore I walk alone
Know thy fate
The meaning of my dreams now clear
Legions wait
And revolution's here

As foretold
The seas of sand are now my home
In days of old
Nevermore I walk alone
Know thy fate
The meaning of my dreams now clear
Legions wait
And revolution's here
